# 2024-4e-hurt-hauerteUnifiedPortal

Integration between Microsoft's SIEM - Azure Senitenel and IRIS  - Open-Source Collaborative Incident Response Platform. Itegration should be fully functional and maintained to the latest version of IRIS. Itegration works in the cloud eviroment which enables anyone to seamlessly delploy this integration without the need to make any changes to the original codebase. As long as backwards compatability in the original IRIS project is ensured this integration will remain functional even without a maintainer. Deployment using Logic Apps also further enables third parties to make easy modifications without neccessearly understading the underlaying infrastracture. hauerteUnifiedPortal is a fork of IRIS. 

Main branch contains Azure Logic Apps definitions in .json format **while IRIS code is on master and develop branch.**
